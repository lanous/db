# Introduction

The purpose of creating this project is to utilize various database types without the need to learn their structures and commands.
Initially, learning this project might seem a bit complex, but using it is enjoyable.
The flexibility of this project is high, and it has significant potential for further development.
These documents are written for users of this project, and development-related documentation is located in the src directory.

One of the drawbacks of this project may appear to be its initial complexity, which might lead one to think itâ€™s not suitable for open-source projects. However, if your project is personal, this library can be quite helpful because:

Automatic Data Encryption: Data encryption is performed automatically.
Extensible Data Type Structures: The data type structures are extensible.
Avoids Database Complexity: It stays clear of database intricacies.
High Scalability: It is highly scalable.

# Overview

```php
$database = new Database\Connect(new LanousConfig);

$Table = $database->OpenTable (MyLanous\Table\Users::class);

$Where = $Table->Where(MyLanous\Table\Users::ID,"=",1);

$data = $Table->Select(
    column: "*",
    distinct: true
)->Extract();

$data->LastRow($data::ObjectType)->first_name->value;
```

As you can see, everything is in an object-oriented manner. In fact, your data table should be defined within a class structure with specific rules and principles so that the data can be handled effectively throughout the project.

## Example of defined table

```php
        $this->AddColumn("ID")
            ->DataType(\MyLanous\DataTypes\Integer::class)
            ->Size(255)
            ->AutoIncrement(true)
            ->Primary();

        $this->AddColumn("first_name")
            ->DataType(\MyLanous\DataTypes\Varchar::class)
            ->Size(255);

        $this->AddColumn("last_name")
            ->DataType(\MyLanous\DataTypes\Varchar::class)
            ->Size(255);

        $this->AddColumn("password")
            ->DataType(\MyLanous\DataTypes\Varchar::class)
            ->Size(255);

        $this->AddColumn("address")
            ->DataType(\MyLanous\DataTypes\ArrayData::class);
            
        # ---------- Data Handling
        $this->Injection("first_name")
            ->Edit(fn($data) => strtolower($data));
        $this->Injection("last_name")
            ->Edit(fn($data) => strtolower($data));

        # Base64 encode/decode password
        $this->Injection("password")
            ->Edit(fn($data) => base64_encode($data));
        $this->Extract("password")
            ->Edit(fn($data) => base64_decode($data));
```

As you can see, data types are of class type and we have placed an example of this class below.

```php
class ArrayData implements \Lanous\db\Structure\DataType {
    const Query = "JSON";
    # The data being input and output is passed to the construct.
    private $data;
    public function __construct($data) {
        $this->data = $data;
    }
    # Before data is entered into the database, it passes through this function.
    public function Injection($data) {
        return json_encode($data);
    }
    # After data is extracted from the database, it also passes through this function.
    public function Extraction($data) {
        return json_decode($data,1);
    }
    # By using this function, we prevent specific types or expressions from entering the database.
    public function Validation($data): bool {
        return is_array($data);
    }
    # You can also add specific functions to these data types.
    # Stay tuned for more documentation!
}
```

The appearance and overall structure of the project make database management easy and pleasant in IDEs.
